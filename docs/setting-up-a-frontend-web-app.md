## Overview

This document gives a way to make a frontend web application with Vue. The steps below are exactly same as "inspired_by" blog.

## Create a vue project with vue-cli

> For information on how to use Vue CLI 3, visit [official documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/)

```bash
vue create inspired_by
```

- What I chose:

```bash
? Please pick a preset: Manually select features
? Check the features needed for your project: Babel, PWA, Router, Vuex, CSS Pre-processors, Linter
? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for index fallback in production) Yes
? Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules are supported by default): Sass/SCSS
? Pick a linter / formatter config: Basic
? Pick additional lint features: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)Lint on save
? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, PostCSS, ESLint, etc.? In dedicated config files
? Save this as a preset for future projects? No
```
